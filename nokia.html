                <p class="description-body">The project's research phase aimed to enhance user engagement and collaboration through detailed analysis and consultations with developers, content heads, and product managers. Emphasising functionality over aesthetics for a developer-focused platform required a shift in work style and extensive research. An inspirational journey curated design elements aligned with project goals, acting as a key reference for the subsequent design phase. Analysing Nokia's websites, including color schemes and typography, guided the project's overall design direction. <span class="bold">Restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), I am unable to disclose detailed information and final screens of the project. </span></p>

The analysis of user behaviour indicated a strong desire for features that would facilitate increased collaboration among developers. We had multiple ideas to bridge the collaboration gap among developers, so we explored concepts like creating a blog-style hub for knowledge sharing, implementing a real-time chat functionality to encourage instant communication, and introducing a collaborative project board to streamline task management and foster a sense of collective progress. </span></p>

                <p class="description-heading">Design Decisions</p> 
                <p class="description-body"><span class="bold">Two column layout:</span><br>
                    To start, the web page had a clear two-column setup that helped make the content balanced and the overall web page easier to use. This layout provides users with an organized and easy-to-understand design that suits how they look for information, making their tasks quicker. One major reason for this change was to create a clear hierarchy and spotlight important parts, guiding users to what matters most. Another reason was to give flexibility to future designers so they can arrange content freely without being tied to a basic layout.</span></p>

                <p class="description-body"><span class="bold">Cards for enhanced content division: </span><br>
                    The second design decision centred around crafting cards that offer ample whitespace and encompass all the necessary information crucial for developers. Rather than placing two cards in a single row, I opted for a layout where each row features just one card. This strategy was chosen to provide developers with a clear and uncluttered visual experience, ensuring that they can readily access all the essential details they require. </span></p>

                <p class="description-body"><span class="bold">Tri-fold searching approach: </span><br>
                    This approach was implemented to facilitate precise content discovery. Firstly, an adjacent search bar was integrated, complemented by filtering alternatives, and finally, sorting options positioned at the top. This combination of searching tools works better for finding content compared to just using a search bar. It's also a widely recognized and commonly used technique in the industry for efficient content searching, therefore it is a more intuitive method, making the website easy to use. </span></p>
