                <div class="content-body">During my time at Nokia with the Network Infrastructure

                    collaboration. <span class="bold">I redesigned the community section of Nokia's Developer Portal Website, addressing 
                    engagement and collaboration challenges. </span>

                        community section is generally a platform that allows people to connect with each other, share information and ideas, 
                        and collaborate on projects. However, this community section did not serve that purpose.</div>

                        Aligning my design roadmap with the development roadmap was crucial. Negotiations with the developer and product manager were 
                        necessary to ensure a solution that meets both user goals and business requirements and is implemented within the six-week 
                        timeframe.

                        While I was creating a completely different information

                        I met with users at the start to understand their pain points, but couldn't test the final solution due to time limits. Instead, I based my decisions on 
                        thorough external research, heuristic analysis, and team input.</div>

                        I began my research by talking to a few end users to grasp how they use the community platform.
                        <span class="bold">They mentioned visiting the community section to discover 
                        useful code examples posted by fellow developers but often struggle to find relevant information due to a lack of search 
                        options. Additionally, they find it challenging to engage with fellow developers for discussions and queries.</span>

                    <div class="content-body">
                        My next step was to conduct a competitive analysis to identify how the big tech companies like Apple, Google, Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, etc., design 
                        their developer community platforms.

                    <div class="content-body">Next, I combined insights from my research and listed a range of potential features 
                        that aimed to enhance collaboration and improve the overall 
                        user experience of the community platform.

                    <div class="content-body">
                        After conducting a detailed analysis with the UX design team, product managers, and developers, 
                        we narrowed down our focus to two main ideas. <span class="bold">The first idea is to create a blog-style hub for 
                        knowledge sharing, and the second is to develop a discussion forum to increase developer engagement.</span>
                        While integrating gamification features seemed promising, it would have required more time than we 
                        had available. Rapidly implementing them might not have brought significant value to the platform. 
                        As a result, we decided to prioritize the blog-style hub and discussion forum as it was feasible within our project's timeframe.

                <div class="content-title">Adding 'User Stories' as a feature</div>
                <div>
                    <div class="content-body">I added a feature called "User Stories," which works like posts on 
                        Reddit or Stack Overflow. Developers can interact with these stories by liking, commenting, replying, and 
                        saving them. <span class="bold">This feature directly addresses the issue mentioned by end users during the initial stages of 
                        my design process, where they found it challenging to engage with fellow developers for discussions and 
                        queries.</span> By providing a platform for these interactions, "User Stories" makes it easier for developers to 
                        share knowledge, ask questions, and collaborate effectively. Here is the information architechture I formulated for this new feature-

                <div class="content-title">Solution</div>
                <div class="content-body">After careful consideration, I concluded 
                    that starting with a blog-style hub coupled with a discussion  
                    forum would initiate engagement effectively. By creating this  
                    hub, developers could easily share insights, improving knowledge 
                    exchange and fostering stronger collaboration.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 1: Two-Column Layout</div>
                <div class="content-body">To start, the web page had a clear two-column setup 
                    that helped make the content balanced and the overall web page easier to use. 
                    This layout provides users with an organized and easy-to-understand design 
                    that suits how they look for information, making their tasks quicker. One 
                    major reason for this change was to create a clear hierarchy and spotlight 
                    important parts, guiding users to what matters most. Another reason was to 
                    give flexibility to future designers so they can arrange content freely 
                    without being tied to a basic layout.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 2: Cards for enhanced content division</div>
                <div class="content-body">The second design decision centred around crafting cards 
                    that offer ample whitespace and encompass all the necessary information crucial 
                    for developers. Rather than placing two cards in a single row, I opted for a 
                    layout where each row features just one card. This strategy was chosen to provide 
                    developers with a clear and uncluttered visual experience, ensuring that they can 
                    readily access all the essential details they require.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 3: Tri-fold searching approach</div>
                <div class="content-body">This approach was implemented to facilitate precise 
                    content discovery. Firstly, an adjacent search bar was integrated, 
                    complemented by filtering alternatives, and finally, sorting options 
                    positioned at the top. This combination of searching tools works better 
                    for finding content compared to just using a search bar. It's also a widely 
                    recognized and commonly used technique in the industry for efficient content 
                    searching, therefore it is a more intuitive method, making the website easy 
                    to use.
