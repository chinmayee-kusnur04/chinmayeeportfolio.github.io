                <div class="content-body">During my time at Nokia with the Network Infrastructure 
                    team, I led a key design project to improve user experience and developer 
                    collaboration. <span class="bold">I redesigned the community section of Nokia's Developer Portal Website, addressing 
                    engagement and collaboration challenges. </span>
                     Restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), I am 
                    unable to disclose detailed information about the project.

                        a space for developers to engage in a community setting</span>. A community section is generally a 
                        platform that allows people to connect with each other, share information and ideas, and collaborate 
                        on projects. However, this community section did not serve that purpose.</div>

                        As I explored new features, I reviewed user data and drew from Nokia's design principles. My goal 
                        was to create tools that met developers' needs. I found that users really wanted better collaboration 
                        features, so I eagerly explored different solutions to address this need.
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-body">
                        During this process, I examined various user behaviors and preferences, 
                        ensuring that the solutions I considered were practical and aligned with what developers were 
                        looking for. I focused on creating an intuitive and cohesive user experience that would facilitate 
                        easier and more efficient collaboration among users.
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-body">
                        By combining insights from my research with creative problem-solving, I 
                        developed a range of potential features that aimed to enhance collaboration and improve the overall 
                        user experience on Nokia's platform.

                    <div class="content-body">
                        After thorough analysis with the UX design team, product managers, and developers, we narrowed our focus 
                        to two key ideas: a blog-style hub for knowledge sharing and a discussion forum. Integrating 
                        gamification features, while promising, would have required more time than we had available. 
                        Rushing their implementation might not have added substantial value to the platform. Therefore, 
                        we prioritized the blog-style hub and discussion forum to ensure we could deliver impactful 
                        features within our project's timeframe.

                    <div class="content-body"><span class="bold">1. Had 6 weeks to design, develop, test and implement:</span>
                        It was crucial to synchronize my design roadmap with the 
                        development roadmap, ensuring alignment with both end user
                        and business requirements. To achieve this, I leveraged 
                        existing elements and made necessary adaptations to seamlessly 
                        integrate them into my design.

                    <div class="content-body"><span class="bold">2. Align the new design to the existing visual design standards:</span>
                        While I was creating a completely different information 
                        architechture, I had to create something that was consistent with the rest of the site.</div>

            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-title">Solution</div>
                <div class="content-body">After careful consideration, I concluded 
                    that starting with a blog-style hub coupled with a discussion  
                    forum would initiate engagement effectively. By creating this  
                    hub, developers could easily share insights, improving knowledge 
                    exchange and fostering stronger collaboration.

            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="content-title">Decision 1: Two-Column Layout</div>
                <div class="content-body">To start, the web page had a clear two-column setup 
                    that helped make the content balanced and the overall web page easier to use. 
                    This layout provides users with an organized and easy-to-understand design 
                    that suits how they look for information, making their tasks quicker. One 
                    major reason for this change was to create a clear hierarchy and spotlight 
                    important parts, guiding users to what matters most. Another reason was to 
                    give flexibility to future designers so they can arrange content freely 
                    without being tied to a basic layout.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 2: Cards for enhanced content division</div>
                <div class="content-body">The second design decision centred around crafting cards 
                    that offer ample whitespace and encompass all the necessary information crucial 
                    for developers. Rather than placing two cards in a single row, I opted for a 
                    layout where each row features just one card. This strategy was chosen to provide 
                    developers with a clear and uncluttered visual experience, ensuring that they can 
                    readily access all the essential details they require.

                <div class="content-title">Decision 3: Tri-fold searching approach</div>
                <div class="content-body">This approach was implemented to facilitate precise 
                    content discovery. Firstly, an adjacent search bar was integrated, 
                    complemented by filtering alternatives, and finally, sorting options 
                    positioned at the top. This combination of searching tools works better 
                    for finding content compared to just using a search bar. It's also a widely 
                    recognized and commonly used technique in the industry for efficient content 
                    searching, therefore it is a more intuitive method, making the website easy 
                    to use.
