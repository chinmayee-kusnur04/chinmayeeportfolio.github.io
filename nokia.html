                        Aligning my design roadmap with the development roadmap was crucial. I needed to negotiate with the developer and product 
                        manager to ensure we found a solution that met both user goals and business requirements and was implemented within the 
                        six-week timeframe.

                        I began my research by talking to a few end users to grasp how they use the community platform.
                        <span class="bold">They mentioned visiting the community section to discover 
                        useful code examples posted by fellow developers but often struggle to find relevant information due to a lack of search

                        we narrowed down our focus to two main ideas. <span class="bold">The first idea is to create a blog-style hub for 
                        knowledge sharing, and the second is to develop a discussion forum to increase developer engagement.</span>
                        While integrating gamification features seemed promising, it would have required more time than we 
                        had available. Rapidly implementing them might not have brought significant value to the platform. 
                        As a result, we decided to prioritize the blog-style hub and discussion forum as it was feasible within our project's timeframe.

                        Reddit or Stack Overflow. Developers can interact with these stories by liking, commenting, replying, and 
                        saving them. <span class="bold">This feature directly addresses the issue mentioned by end users during the initial stages of

                        queries.</span> By providing a platform for these interactions, "User Stories" makes it easier for developers to 
                        share knowledge, ask questions, and collaborate effectively. Here is the information architechture I formulated for this new feature-

                    <div class="content-body">
                    Based on competitive analysis and user research, the decision to implement a two-column layout was made to enhance the usability and overall experience of the developer community portal.

                    <div class="content-body">
                        During initial discussions with developers, they expressed concerns about the older page layout,

                        effective search options and content organization was a significant pain point. The new two-column 
                        layout directly addresses these issues by dedicating the left column to navigation and search options, 
                        and the right column to main content, facilitating better engagement and interaction.</span>

                    <div class="content-body">

                        expressed a need for a more organized and cleaner presentation of content. Implementing a single card per row, with
