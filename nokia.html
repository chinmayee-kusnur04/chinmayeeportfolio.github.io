                        During my time at Nokia with the Network Infrastructure team, I led a key design project to enhance 
                        user experience and developer collaboration by redesigning the community section of the Developer 
                        Portal Website to address engagement challenges. I owned the process from ideation to implementation 
                        and had the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams, including developers, product 
                        line managers, designers, and content writers.

                            The community section of the developer portal is primarily a content repository, providing feature

                            found in a developer community platform. As a result, developers are unable to connect, share ideas, 
                            and collaborate on projects, leading to lower engagement and limited peer-to-peer support.

                        I began my research by talking to a few stakeholders like, developers and product managers to grasp how they use the community platform.

                        useful code examples posted by fellow developers but often struggle to find relevant information due to a lack of search

                        Working with a globally distributed team at Nokia presented unique challenges. I was in

                        to get everyone on the same page. I created a pitch deck, arranged a team-wide meeting, 
                       to align the team on project goals.</span> From then 
                        on, I presented progress every 1-2 weeks, maintaining transparency and consistent 
                        collaboration despite the distance.

                        After conducting a detailed analysis with the UX design team, product managers, and developers, 
                        we narrowed down our focus to two main ideas. <span class="bold">The first idea is to create a blog-style hub for 
                        knowledge sharing, and the second is to develop a discussion forum to increase developer engagement.</span>
                        While integrating gamification features seemed promising, it would have required more time than we 
                        had available. Rapidly implementing them might not have brought significant value to the platform. 
                        As a result, we decided to prioritize the blog-style hub and discussion forum as it was feasible within our project's timeframe.

                    <div class="content-body">Based on our meetings and I added a feature called "User Stories," which works like posts on 
                        Reddit or Stack Overflow. This was a feature that was collectively decided by all stakeholders involved, where developers can interact with these stories by liking, commenting, replying, and 
                        saving them. <span class="bold">This feature directly addresses the issue mentioned by end users during the initial stages of 
                        my design process, where they found it challenging to engage with fellow developers for discussions and 
                        queries.</span> Here is the information architechture I formulated for this new feature-

                    With just 6 weeks to design, develop, and implement, collaborating closely with the development team 
                    was essential. I worked with the developer and product manager to align our roadmaps and balance user 
                    goals with business needs. I also took the time to understand which features were costly to build, 
                    sitting down with the developer to review the existing code. By adjusting some of my designs to fit 
                    within those technical limitations, we were able to stay on track and meet the deadline while still
