            <p class="project-body">I love exploring the dynamic connection between data and design. I apply design thinking and user research to tackle tricky problems, always prioritizing ethics and principles to create user-friendly solutions that are ethical, inclusive, and sustainable. I have 1.5 year of design experience @Simon Fraser University, @Nokia and @Form Swim. </p>

            <p class="about-heading">Other than Design</p> 
            <p class="project-body">I was honored to be a runner-up for the UN Women Award, I distributed Khadi face masks during COVID-19 to support sustainability and empower women artisans. Besides design, I'm a foodie and travel enthusiast, drawing inspiration from diverse cultures for my work. I'm keen on collaborating with like-minded folks and organizations to bring positive change through data-driven design. Let's connect! Whether it's about design opportunities, sustainability, or sharing travel stories over coffee, I'm all ears. Reach out to me at kusnurchinmayee@gmail.com. Can't wait to hear from you! â˜•</p>
