                <div class="content-body">I designed the "Be Water Positive" campaign, a partnership 
                  between the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) and AquaKraft, for the annual 
                  2023 award show held in Abu Dhabi, UAE. This project aimed to inform people about 
                  the water crisis in India and raise awareness about water conservation. By creating 
                  engaging visuals and compelling stories, the campaign successfully reached millions, 
                  emphasising the importance of sustainable water practices and making a significant 
                  impact on public awareness.   </div>

                <div class="content-title">My Role</div>
                <div class="content-body">My role in the "Be Water Positive" campaign was to create the 
                  main logo and design the website. I developed a striking logo that conveyed the campaign's 
                  message of sustainability. The website provided an engaging user experience with compelling 
                  visuals and clear information, serving as the central hub for the campaign's details.

Designing perfectly for the global audience:</span> With 71 million viewers engaging with the "Be Water Positive" campaign, maintaining brand consistency was crucial. Despite working remotely from Vancouver while the team operated from Mumbai and Abu Dhabi, I learned to manage details meticulously and uphold the campaign's standards. This experience strengthened my ability to deliver high-quality work under pressure, ensuring our message reached and resonated with a vast global audience.
