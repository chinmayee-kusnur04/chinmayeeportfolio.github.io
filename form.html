                <p class="description-body">In summer 2022, I had a fantastic opportunity to intern at FORM as a digital product designer. I met some amazing people there who helped me grow as a designer, and I will always be grateful for this chance I got. </p>

                <p class="description-body">My primary responsibilities were working closely with other Product team members to brainstorm ideas to improve the swim experience for users. Secondly, to craft UX deliverables such as annotated user flows and wireframes to effectively communicate design ideas. Lastly, to deliver high-fidelity UI designs for iOS, Android and FORM goggles.</p>

                <p class="description-heading">What Did I Do?</p> 
                <img src="img/workoutfilters_form.png" alt="Workout filters" class="desc-image s">
                <p class="description-body"><span class="bold">Workout Filters</span> were the main feature I worked on at FORM. From understanding technical swim terms to ad-hoc user testing and prototyping, I was responsible for the design process. <span class="bold">The main goal to accomplish with these filters was to enable swimmers to find the best workout for their next swim.</span> I designed 6 filters: Duration, Pool Size, Stroke, Drills, Equipment, and Longest Interval.</p> 
                <p class="description-body s">My process started with analyzing how FORM's competitors use filters on their apps. The most challenging filters to design were duration, pool size and longest interval. Here are a few of my sketches/iterations of some filters.</p>
                <img src="img/sketches_form.png" alt="Workout filters" class="desc-image s">
                <p class="description-body s">After prototyping the potential sketches, I also conducted ad-hoc usability tests with swimmers in the office to create the best user filters. This helped me understand the different pain points and requirements of swimmers. Based on the user testing, I concluded that potential users might need more context for some filters. Hence I added more information via the tooltip icon, as shown below.</p>
                <img src="img/filterprocess_form.png" alt="Workout filters" class="desc-image s">
                <p class="description-body s">Initially, the application had only 3 filters, and after the addition of 6 filters, the filter page was long, and the user had to scroll for a while to see the last filter. Therefore, made the filter page in an accordion style to make the filtering process easy with utmost transparency. </p>

                <p class="description-body"><span class="bold">1. Design Systems:</span> I was exposed to a design system more extensive than I had ever used before. I learned how to use components, instances and variants, which helped me be more consistent and detail-oriented.</span></p>
                <p class="description-body"><span class="bold">2. Negotiation:</span> I honed my negotiation skills, delving into the intricacies of my designs, estimating implementation timelines for release schedules.  </span></p>
