                    focussed on creating innovative and energy-efficient solutions for drinking 
                    water and sanitation. They believe in transforming communities by turning barren 
                    lands green and bringing water back to dry taps. They are a part of UN Global 
                    Compact India and aim to reach the UN Sustainable Development Goal of Clean 
                    Water and Sanitation in india before 2030.  </div>

                <div class="content-title">What did they want?</div>
                <div class="content-body">They wanted to revamp their existing website, which 
                    lacked an enticing story for potential customers and investors. Apart from 
                    the website, they also wanted me to create a corporate video, a letter head 
                    for their business documents and visiting card templates. Their goal was to 
                    create a visually compelling corporate website that truly highlighted their 
                    achievements. Moreover, some key topics they wanted to highlight all over 
                    the website were-

                <div class="content-body">I was confident in my assumptions but wanted to validate them with real feedback. 
                    So, I reached out to two investors and existing corporate customers in India to gather their thoughts on 
                    the website. Their feedback confirmed my suspicions—they struggled to understand AquaKraft's services and 
                    mission from the current website. 

                    One thing that caught my attention was a comment from a corporate customer. They mentioned that AquaKraft 
                    wins awards and gets featured in articles and videos often, but this isn't clearly shown on the website. 
                    This insight underscores the importance of showcasing such achievements to increase AquaKraft’s and the 
                    website's credibility.

                    effectively in my design process. Starting with these simplified layouts allowed rapid

                    foundation for the interface design.

                    guidelines to create a cohesive and appealing look. I also chose SF Pro Extended as the 
                    main font because my research showed that sans-serif fonts, which offer a modern and 
                    professional feel, are popular on sustainability websites. This combination helped make 
                    AquaKraft's site look both contemporary and credible.

                <div class="content-body">The team lacked images for their new services, which posed a significant challenge. 
                    To address this, we used a combination of rendered images and AI-generated visuals. 
                    I specifically leveraged Microsoft AI to create detailed images for the sewage water recycling treatment 
                    technology.

                </div>

                <div class="content-body">Another constraint was the tight 4-week timeline, as the company aimed to launch the new 
                    website before attending a UN conference. This required working in a fast-paced environment, making stakeholder 
                    management crucial for clear communication with the C-level team, product manager, and marketing team. To ensure 
                    efficient communication and gather insights, I scheduled weekly meetings and streamlined the process. Additionally, 
                    I initiated a Slack channel for ongoing communication and quick responses when needed.</div>

                <div class="content-body">This project was an incredible experience, allowing me to learn about AquaKraft and 
                    enhance their brand through storytelling and design. Even though I've completed the design, I remain in 
                    constant contact with the developer to ensure my pixel-perfect designs are implemented correctly. To 
                    further improve the site, I've sent survey links to potential customers and investors from the company's 
                    contacts, aiming to gather at least 30 responses for feedback. Additionally, I am organizing a team of 
                    photographers to capture real images of the implemented systems, making the website look more professional. 
                    As a result of these efforts, user traffic has increased by 25%.
